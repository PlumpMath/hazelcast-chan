# hazelcast-chan

A Clojure library for creating core.async channels which put onto and take from Hazelcast distributed queues.


## Usage

In one REPL do...
```
(require '[hazelcast-chan.core :refer [new-hazelcast-instance hazelcast-chan]])
(require '[clojure.core.async :refer [<!!]])
(def hc (new-hazelcast-instance))
;; Lots of logs as Hazelcast starts a node.
(def chan-a (hazelcast-chan hc "spinal"))
(loop []
  (println (<!! chan-a) " Rock & Roll!)
  (recur))
```
Then in another...
```
(require '[hazelcast-chan.core :refer [new-hazelcast-instance hazelcast-chan]])
(require '[clojure.core.async :refer [>!!]])
(def hc (new-hazelcast-instance))
;; Lots of logs as Hazelcast joins the cluster.
(def chan-b (hazelcast-chan hc "spinal"))
(>!! chan-b "Hello Cleveland!")
```
